# Inference methods

TreePPL supports several inference methods.
The user needs to select the inference method and options.
To get a complete list of the available methods and options the user can type `tpplc --help` on the command line, which will provide all supported command-line options.
One can define the schema by issuing a command-line compilation command, or by making the appropriate choices in Python or R.
Please find below a reference list of the supported strategies with an explanation.

## Importance Sampling

```bash
tpplc <program> -m is-lw
```

This is a basic inference schema that should not be used for complex models.
It is useful for illustrating and understanding probabilistic programming.

#### Options available

```bash
--particles INT                   The number of particles (i.e., samples or iterations). The default is 5000
--no-early-stop                   Disables early stopping in certain inference algorithms.
--cps ARG                         Configuration of CPS transformation (only applicable to certain inference algorithms). The supported options are: none, partial, and full. Default: full.
--dynamic-delay                   Runs dynamic delayed sampling on the model.
--prune                           The model is pruned if possible.
```

## Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) Methods

TreePPL supports two SMC methods:

  - bootstrap particle filter (BPF), and
  - alive particle filter (APF).

### Bootstrap particle filter (BPF)

```bash
tpplc <program> -m smc-bpf
```

This is the classical SMC schema.
Except in special cases, the alive particle filter (APF) should be preferred as the BPF can suffer from path degeneration.

This inference is affected by the resample placement method.

#### Options available

```bash
--particles INT                   The number of particles (i.e., samples or iterations). The default is 5000
--subsample                       Whether to subsample the posterior distribution.
--subsample-size INT              The number of subsamples to draw if --subsample is selected. Default: 1
--resample ARG                    The selected resample placement method, for inference algorithms where applicable. The supported methods are: likelihood (resample immediately after all likelihood updates), align (resample after aligned likelihood updates, forces --align), and manual (sample only at manually defined resampling locations). Default: manual
--resample-frac FLOAT             Floating point number to trigger resampling for SMC-BPF when ESS is less than resampleFrac Ã— particleCount. Default: 0.7
--cps ARG                         Configuration of CPS transformation (only applicable to certain inference algorithms). The supported options are: none, partial, and full. Default: full.
--prune                           The model is pruned if possible.
--dynamic-delay                   Runs dynamic delayed sampling on the model.
```

### Alive particle filter (APF)

```bash
tpplc <program> -m smc-apf
```

This is a more advanced SMC schema than BPF.
It avoids path degeneration by keeping a population of particles alive.

#### Options available

```bash
--particles INT                   The number of particles (i.e., samples or iterations). The default is 5000
--subsample                       Whether to subsample the posterior distribution.
--subsample-size INT              The number of subsamples to draw if --subsample is selected. Default: 1
--resample ARG                    The selected resample placement method, for inference algorithms where applicable. The supported methods are: likelihood (resample immediately after all likelihood updates), align (resample after aligned likelihood updates, forces --align), and manual (sample only at manually defined resampling locations). Default: manual
--cps ARG                         Configuration of CPS transformation (only applicable to certain inference algorithms). The supported options are: none, partial, and full. Default: full.
--prune                           The model is pruned if possible.
```

## Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Methods

TreePPL supports a range of MCMC methods:

  - Lightweight MCMC
  - Naive and Trace MCMC
  - particle MCMC--particle-independent Metropolis-Hastings

### Lightweight MCMC

```bash
tpplc <program> -m mcmc-lightweight
```

This is the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schema that should be used in most cases.
Moves are proposed by resampling one `assume` statement at random.
Draws that are aligned together with some unaligned draws are reused to save computational effort.
It has an option of whether to do a continuation-passing style transformation in order to avoid recomputation of the likelihood. For details, see [Lunden et al. 2024](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-57267-8_12).

#### Options available

```bash
--align                           Whether or not to align the model for certain inference algorithms.
--debug-iterations                Output various debug information each iteration.
--sampling-period N               Sample the mcmc-chain every Nth iteration. Default: 1
--incremental-printing            Print each sample as it is produced instead of at the end.
--particles INT                   The number of particles (i.e., samples or iterations). The default is 5000
--mcmc-lw-gprob FLOAT             The probability of performing a global MH step (non-global means only modify a single sample in the previous trace). Default: 0.1
--kernel                          Use drift Kernel in MCMC.
--drift FLOAT                     Floating point number which corresponds to the standard deviation (sigma) of the normal distribution that will be used for the automatic drift kernel. Default: 1.
--cps ARG                         Configuration of CPS transformation (only applicable to certain inference algorithms). The supported options are: none, partial, and full. Default: full.
--debug-alignment-html FILE       Output an interactive .html file showing alignment results to the given file.
```

### Naive and Trace MCMC

```bash
tpplc <program> -m mcmc-naive
tpplc <program> -m mcmc-trace
```

The new proposed sample is a complete rerun of the entire simulation.
Those are pedagogical methods that should not be used for real problems.

#### Options available

```bash
--particles INT                   The number of particles (i.e., samples or iterations). The default is 5000
```

### Particle MCMC--Particle independent Metropolis-Hastings (PMCMC-PIMH)

```bash
tpplc <program> -m pmcmc-pimh
```

This is perhaps the simplest version of an SMC-within-MCMC approach, where each proposal in the MCMC is a full set of samples (particles) generated by SMC.

[Reference: Paige 2014](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/paige14.pdf).

#### Options available

```bash
--pmcmcParticles INT              The number of particles for the smc proposal computation. The default is 2
--particles INT                   The number of particles (i.e., samples or iterations). The default is 5000
--cps ARG                         Configuration of CPS transformation (only applicable to certain inference algorithms). The supported options are: none, partial, and full. Default: full.
```
